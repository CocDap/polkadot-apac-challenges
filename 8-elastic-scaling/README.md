# Challenge 8: Elastic Scaling

## üìã Overview
Configure parachain runtime for elastic scaling with increased block processing velocity and optimized segment capacity.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time
**5 days**

## üéØ Requirements

### 1. Enable Asynchronous Backing
Elastic scaling is an extension of asynchronous backing. You must first ensure your parachain has asynchronous backing enabled. This involves configuring the `pallet_aura` to allow multiple blocks per slot and adjusting the `MILLIS_PER_BLOCK` to match the relay chain's slot time (typically 6 seconds).

### 2. Configure Runtime Parameters
Modify your parachain's `runtime/src/lib.rs` to support elastic scaling. This involves:

- **Increasing the `MAX_BLOCK_PROCESSING_VELOCITY`** constant to a value greater than `1` (e.g., `3`). This parameter dictates the maximum number of parachain blocks that can be processed per relay chain block.
- **Setting the `UNINCLUDED_SEGMENT_CAPACITY`** constant to a value greater than `2 * MAX_BLOCK_PROCESSING_VELOCITY + 1`. This parameter helps manage the queue of unincluded blocks.

### 3. Start a Relay Chain
You must start a local relay chain (e.g., using `polkadot-launch` or `zombienet`) that is compatible with elastic scaling.

### 4. Start a Parachain
You must start your modified parachain node and connect it to the relay chain, demonstrating that it successfully registers and begins producing blocks at an increased velocity.

## üì§ How to Submit

You'll need to create a Pull Request (PR) containing a link to your GitHub repository where you have made the necessary code changes in the parachain's runtime to enable elastic scaling.
