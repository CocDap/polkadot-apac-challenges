# Challenge 1: Batch Transactions

## üìã Overview
Learn how to add `pallet-utility` to your runtime and demonstrate batch transfers using Polkadot-JS Apps UI.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time
**2 days**

## üéØ Requirements

### 1. Add `pallet-utility` to your runtime
This involves modifying your project's `Cargo.toml` file to include the `pallet-utility` dependency and then configuring it in your runtime's `lib.rs` file. You need to enable the `std` feature in `Cargo.toml` for the pallet as well.

### 2. Interact with `pallet-utility`
Use the **Polkadot-JS Apps UI** (the explorer) to create and sign a batch extrinsic. You'll need to construct a series of `balances.transfer` calls and then wrap them in a `utility.batch` call. This will transfer funds to multiple wallets in a single transaction.

## üì§ How to Submit

You'll need to create a Pull Request (PR) that includes two things:

1. **Link to the code** that has been modified to include the `pallet-utility`
2. **Video recording** that demonstrates the successful execution of the batch transfer using the Polkadot-JS Apps UI

## üìö Related Lessons

This challenge is directly related to:
- **Lesson 3.4** - "Adding a custom logic to a Runtime"
- **Lesson 3.9** - "Interact with Substrate node on PolkadotJS Apps"

The lesson focuses on understanding and implementing custom runtime logic, with the `pallet-utility` batch transfer being a practical application of this concept.
