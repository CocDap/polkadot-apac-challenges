# Create On-chain Identity Dapp  Challenge

- **Estimated Time:** 3 days.
- **Requirements:**
    1. **Create a UI:** The dApp's user interface must allow users to register their on-chain identity. This involves creating a form where they can input their display name, legal name, and a GitHub link.
    2. **Show identity info:** After a user connects their wallet, the dApp should display their already-registered identity information (display name, legal name, GitHub link) by querying the blockchain's storage.
    3. **Target Network:** The dApp should be built to interact with the **Paseo testnet**, which is the go-to testnet for Polkadot dApp developers.
- How to Submit:
    
    You'll need to submit a Pull Request (PR) containing three key components:
    
    1. **Link to the code:** A link to the GitHub repository where the dApp's source code is hosted.
    2. **Link to the deployed dApp:** A link to a live version of the dApp, likely deployed on a platform like Vercel, so that it can be tested directly.
    3. **Video recording:** A video demonstrating the entire process of connecting a wallet, registering an on-chain identity, and then viewing that identity information on the dApp.
